# Physics 201 - General Physics

#Text: 	

OpenStax University Physics – Volume I – http://www.openstax.org	

This textbook is freely available online, and there is a print version available on Amazon that is quite reasonably priced.  There is also an OpenStax app for your phone or tablet that I highly recommend.  The homework problems will be from this book as well.  

#Course Learning Objectives: 

Upon completion of Physics 201, a student should be able to:

1) identify and apply appropriate models, laws and equations to physical problems involving forces and motion.
2) differentiate between scalar and vector quantities.
3) apply free body diagrams and unit vector notation to solve problems involving vectors
in translational and rotational kinematics and dynamics.
4) solve problems in mechanics using conserved quantities.

#Physics Topics: 
Units, conversion, and problem solving.  Kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration).  Circular motion.  Forces and Newton’s laws.  Work, kinetic energy, and potential energy.   Linear momentum and collisions.  Rotational kinematics and dynamics.
